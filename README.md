# Kaggle Housing Data

This project was created as part of a end of semester project for computational statistics

## Descrption
Real world datasets have multiple cells that are missing, have error in values or hard for machine to interpret. For instance, categorical variables for color such as red, blue, green etc. Therefore imputation methods and encoding methods have to be used to clean and treat data in order for models to be built.

## Project Components


## Challenges we ran into
Finding suitable APIs and libraries to use from react-native libraries Since our team is new to mobile app development, it would take a longer period of time to build an app like this React-native platforms using Expo.io lack extensive libraries
