# Kaggle Housing Data
This project was created as part of a end of semester project for computational statistics

## Description
Real world datasets have multiple cells that are missing, have error in values or hard for machine to interpret. For instance, categorical variables for color such as red, blue, green etc. Therefore imputation methods and encoding methods have to be used to clean and treat data in order for models to be built.

## Project Components
There is a R markdown file that contains code to run operations on training and testing data. A project report in pdf format is also attached to present our findings. 

## Future improvement
Data modeling was carried out by using a simple multiple linear regression after preliminary data treatment. More advanced regression techniques can be used to get a higher accuracy.
